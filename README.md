# On-Demand-Sales-Insights

🚀 PROJECT MILESTONE UNLOCKED 🚀

I'm excited to unveil the outcomes of a high-impact, results-driven initiative I successfully completed as part of the CodeBasics Resume Project Challenge #4—a rewarding experience that sharpened my analytical and storytelling capabilities.

🔍 PROJECT OBJECTIVE
This project centered around addressing a series of ad-hoc analytical requests for AtliQ Hardware, a prominent name in the computer hardware industry. The core challenge was to distill complex, multi-dimensional data into actionable insights that could enable senior leadership to make strategic, data-informed decisions—ultimately guiding the company’s growth and performance.

🛠️ TOOLS & METHODOLOGY

Tools Utilized: MySQL for advanced data querying, and Excel for compelling data visualization.

Analytical Approach: Employed advanced SQL techniques such as Common Table Expressions (CTEs), Window Functions, JOINS, and Subqueries to extract key business metrics—ranging from regional sales performance and channel efficiency to discount impact analysis. These insights were then translated into visually engaging dashboards in Excel, delivering clarity and strategic value to stakeholders.

📚 KEY LEARNINGS & SKILL ENHANCEMENTS
• Deepened my command of advanced SQL concepts, including window functions, complex joins, and CTEs, enabling more robust and scalable data analysis.
• Gained hands-on experience with Excel’s advanced visualization capabilities, crafting interactive and insightful dashboards that effectively communicate data stories.
• Sharpened my ability to translate analytical findings into clear, actionable insights, enhancing the impact of data-driven storytelling.

📈 IMPACT & VALUE DELIVERED
